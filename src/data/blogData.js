How to treat male infertility? 6 effective ways to treat male infertility

Male infertility is an increasingly common condition that significantly affects psychology and family happiness. According to statistics, male infertility accounts for about 40-50% of infertility cases in couples. So how is male infertility treated and what are the effective male infertility treatment methods available today?

1. Using medication

In many cases, male infertility is caused by hormonal disorders or genital tract infections. Doctors may prescribe antibiotics, hormone-regulating drugs, or vitamin and mineral supplements to improve sperm quality and quantity.

2. Lifestyle and diet changes

A scientific diet rich in protein, vitamins C, E, zinc, selenium combined with regular physical exercise helps enhance reproductive health. Avoiding stimulants like alcohol, tobacco, and reducing stress also helps improve sperm quality.

3. Surgical treatment

Some cases of male infertility due to vas deferens obstruction, varicocele, or congenital abnormalities can be treated with surgery. This method yields high effectiveness if performed with the right indication and technique.

4. Assisted reproduction with IUI technique

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a common assisted reproductive technique, applied for cases of weak sperm, low count, or abnormal cervix in the wife. Sperm will be washed and selected before being injected into the uterus.

5. In vitro fertilization (IVF/ICSI)

When the above methods are ineffective, in vitro fertilization is the optimal solution. In particular, ICSI technique (injecting sperm into the egg cytoplasm) helps increase the chances of conception for cases with very weak or abnormal sperm.

6. Psychological therapy and counseling

Prolonged stress and anxiety can reduce sperm quality. Therefore, couples should maintain an optimistic attitude, ready to share with doctors and relatives to get the best psychological support during treatment.

Conclusion:
Male infertility treatment requires coordination between medical expertise, lifestyle changes, and patience from both spouses. Early detection and examination at reputable specialized facilities will help increase the success rate and bring happiness to many families.

What is penile hypersensitivity? How to deal with penile hypersensitivity?

Penile hypersensitivity is a fairly common condition in men, but is rarely shared due to feelings of embarrassment. So what is penile hypersensitivity, what causes it, and how to address it? Let's explore in this article.

What is penile hypersensitivity?

Penile hypersensitivity is a condition where the glans or the entire penis is easily overstimulated when there is physical or sexual stimulation. The most common manifestation is when even slight contact or exposure to a moist environment or clothing causes discomfort, "ticklish" sensations, or arousal too quickly. In some men, this can lead to premature ejaculation, making it difficult to control the timing of climax.

Causes of penile hypersensitivity

There are many causes that make the penis become sensitive, including:

Foreskin that is too long or tight: Makes the glans less exposed to the external environment, so it's easily stimulated when there is contact.
Poor hygiene: Causes the genital area to become infected, increasing discomfort and irritation.
Psychological stress and anxiety: Makes the body more sensitive to sexual stimulation.
Sensory nerve disorders: Some people have strongly developed peripheral nervous systems, leading to more sensitive sensations in the penis than normal.

How to deal with penile hypersensitivity?

Here are some solutions for men with penile hypersensitivity:

Proper genital hygiene: Clean the penis and foreskin daily with clean water, avoid using soap or solutions with strong detergents.
Circumcision: If the foreskin is long/tight, visit a reputable medical facility for consultation and circumcision procedure, helping the glans gradually get used to external stimulation.
Practice emotional control: Relaxation, exercise, yoga, or breathing control skills help improve psychology, reduce hypersensitivity.
Use condoms: Condoms not only help prevent disease transmission but also reduce penis sensitivity during intercourse.
Consult experts: If the sensitivity affects sexual activity or family happiness, see a urologist for proper diagnosis and treatment.

Conclusion:
Penile hypersensitivity is not a serious problem if detected and treated properly. Men should not be insecure or hesitant, but take initiative in finding solutions to improve the quality of their sex life and protect reproductive health.    `.trim(),

Do you know how to read semen analysis results to assess male reproductive health? In 10 minutes, this article provides detailed guidance on important indicators such as volume, density, motility, sperm morphology... What's normal, what's weak? When should you seek specialized examination? Read the article to correctly identify abnormalities, understand the meaning of each indicator, and receive advice from experts to improve sperm quality and increase chances of natural conception.

Specifically, normal semen volume ranges from 1.5-5ml, sperm density above 15 million/ml, motility rate above 40%, normal morphology above 4%. If these indicators are lower than reference values, they may reflect poor sperm quality, affecting fertility. In addition, factors such as pH, color, and viscosity should also be noted. Semen analysis results are only part of the assessment; doctors will also rely on clinical findings and other tests to determine causes and treatment directions. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, avoiding stress, proper nutrition, and periodic re-examination will help improve sperm quality, increase the chances of natural conception, and enhance the effectiveness of modern assisted reproductive techniques.

The menstrual cycle is a natural physiological process that reflects women's reproductive health. In 9 minutes, this article clearly explains each stage of the cycle, normal signs, hormonal changes, and common issues. You will learn how to track, identify abnormalities, and get advice to better care for your health every day.

Each menstrual cycle typically lasts 28-35 days, including stages: menstruation, follicular phase, ovulation, and luteal phase. Changes in estrogen and progesterone hormones control this entire process, affecting mood, skin, reproductive health, and fertility. When there are abnormal signs such as delayed periods, menorrhagia, severe abdominal pain, or changes in menstrual blood volume, you should see a doctor for early diagnosis of issues like hormonal disorders, uterine fibroids, or endometriosis. Tracking your cycle with apps or personal notes helps you be proactive in health care and appropriate reproductive planning. Additionally, maintaining a balanced diet, exercising, and managing stress also contribute to stabilizing the menstrual cycle and improving overall health.

Want to choose the right contraceptive method? This article compiles modern contraceptive methods such as oral contraceptives, IUDs, condoms, implants, tubal ligation..., analyzing the pros and cons of each method in 8 minutes of reading. You'll gain knowledge to make decisions based on personal needs, health conditions, and expert advice.

Contraceptive pills help effectively control reproduction but may cause side effects like nausea, weight gain, or menstrual disorders. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are suitable for women who have had children, have long-term effects but may cause abdominal pain or infections. Contraceptive implants are simple, highly effective, with effects lasting 3-5 years but at a higher cost. Condoms are a common, easy-to-use method that also prevents sexually transmitted diseases but may reduce sensation. Tubal ligation or vasectomy are permanent methods, suitable for people who no longer want children. To choose an appropriate method, you should consult a doctor, consider your health condition, personal needs, and future reproductive plans.
